# this is how you comment with a hash and a space 
# strings are always typed inside " " 
# the variable values can be adjusted whenever to change the output it prints 
# print() function is used to print 

character_name = "Dee"
character_age= "20"
print("my name is" + character_name + ",") # the part which has the comma will make sure that the variable value gets printed there 
print("age " + character_age + ",")
is_old = True # this how you assign boolean values and it's not exactly used here




##to just print out a string 
phrase = "Girl on fire"
print(phrase + " is cool")

##you can also add fuctions to the end of the variable to change the string or get some kinda output from it 
phrase = "Girl on fire"
print(phrase.lower()) # outputs phrase in lower case 

##
phrase = "Girl on fire"
print(phrase.isupper()) # would check if phrase is upper then would return either true or false

#you can also combine two functions for example,
phrase = "Girl on fire"
print(phrase.upper().isupper()) #this would turn phrase into uppercase and then run the next function which then would return true 

##you can find the legth of phrase by 
phrase = "Girl on fire"
print(lenphrase)

##you can find the letter of a certain index by
phrase = "Girl on fire"
print(phrase[0])#this returns G becuase in python the first postion is 0

##you can find out the index of cetrain letter by
phrase = "Girl on fire"
print(phrase.index("G")) #this would return 0

##or you can replce words or letters 
phrase = "Girl on fire"
print(phrase.replace("girl","boy")) this would return boy on fire
